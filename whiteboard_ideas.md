gesture ideas:
- [x] right click and drag to pan
- [x] shift click to erase
    - [-] faster wiggles back and forth to erase -> larger eraser radius
    - [x] erase by deleting paths,
    not just creating white lines?
    - [ ] erase by selecting polygon around paths to delete?

other features:
- [x] undo
    - [x] wiggling for many redos, ie undo each time detect change in direction
- [ ] redo
    - [ ] track commands for controls like redo, smart panning, ...
    standard draw command: path, color, line width
    erase command: path, zipped with line widths at each point
    change color command
- [x] clear all (small button like top right corner or something)
- [x] zoom in/out
    - [x] slider on the side/corner? easy access but not in the way
    
- [~] change colors (r,g,b, keep it simple)

    down the road...
    - [ ] networking to communicate between two people??i guess just hosted on a little server using sockets or something
    - [ ] local bluetooth?????

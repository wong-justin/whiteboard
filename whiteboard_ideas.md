gesture ideas:
- [x] right click and drag to pan
- [-] shift click to erase
    - [-] faster wiggles back and forth to erase -> larger eraser radius
    
- [ ] erase by deleting paths,
    not just creating white lines?

other features:
- [x] undo
    - [x] wiggling for many redos, ie undo each time detect change in direction
- [ ] redo
- [x] clear all (small button like top right corner or something)
- [x] zoom in/out
    - [x] slider on the side/corner? easy access but not in the way
    
- [ ] change colors (r,g,b, keep it simple)

    down the road...
    - [ ] networking to communicate between two people??i guess just hosted on a little server using sockets or something
    - [ ] local bluetooth?????

- [ ] track commands for controls like redo, smart panning, ...
standard draw command: path, color, line width
erase command: path, zipped with line widths at each point
change color command

- [ ] export as image
